Batch containers
================

Batch containers are a specific type of containers that make "batch" operations on courses.
They can take as input all the submissions of a course and do, for example, a detection of plagiarism among all the students.

Batch containers do very specific actions and sometimes are made for a specific course. **In order to create a new batch container, make sure you
tried before to create a standard (grading) container for INGInious (see :doc:`create_container`)**.

Input, output, and metadata
---------------------------

A batch container is fully described by its metadata. The metadata of the container image contains its title, description, and its arguments.

An argument is itself composed of a ``key``, a ``name``, a ``path`` and a ``type``. For starting a batch job, the user has to fill in all the
arguments, that will be mounted in the container in the folder ``/input/path``, where ``path`` is the one you indicated to describe the argument.
The ``name`` part of the argument is only used for displaying, and the ``key`` is used for internal purposes only (besides a little exception,
see below)

There are two types of arguments: ``file`` and ``text``. As you can guess, the difference is simply that while the ``file`` type take a file
as input, ``text`` takes a single line of text. Both (even ``text``) are still mounted in the folder ``/input/...`` as said earlier.

The return value of a working batch container script should always be 0. In this case, the content of the ``/output/`` will be stored in the
database and made available for the staff of the course.

Taking course data and submissions as input
-------------------------------------------

In order to receive the course data (the content of the folder of the course) and/or all the submissions made from the course, you simply have to
create an argument with type ``file`` and ``key`` respectively equal to ``course`` or ``submissions``.

The file mounted on the given path will then be a ``.tar.gz`` archive.

For the ``submissions``, two additional metaparameters can be defined:

``folder_format``
    Indicates how submissions will be stored in the tgz. Correct values are

    - ``taskid/username``
    - ``taskid/group``
    - ``username/taskid``
    - ``group/taskid``
    - ``taskid``
    - ``group``
    - ``username``
    - and more generally, any combination of ``username``, ``group`` and ``taskid`` separated by ``/``.

``best_only``
    Indicates if the archive should contains all the submissions or only the best ones. Valid (boolean) values are ``"0"`` and ``"1"``.

Indicating metadata in the Dockerfile
-------------------------------------

Here is an example of how to include metadata in the Dockerfile:

::

    # This container is a batch one
    LABEL org.inginious.batch=1

    #
    # Some Metadata for the container
    #
    LABEL org.inginious.batch.title="Test Batch Container"
    LABEL org.inginious.batch.description="A simple test backend container that put a simple website in its results."

    # Course files
    LABEL org.inginious.batch.args.course=file
    LABEL org.inginious.batch.args.course.name="Course"
    LABEL org.inginious.batch.args.course.path="course.tgz"
    LABEL org.inginious.batch.args.course.description="The course files"

    # Submissions
    LABEL org.inginious.batch.args.submissions=file
    LABEL org.inginious.batch.args.submissions.name="Submissions"
    LABEL org.inginious.batch.args.submissions.path="submissions.tgz"
    LABEL org.inginious.batch.args.submissions.description="All submissions made by students"
    LABEL org.inginious.batch.args.submissions.folder_format="taskid/username"
    LABEL org.inginious.batch.args.submissions.best_only="1"

    # Text
    LABEL org.inginious.batch.args.text=text
    LABEL org.inginious.batch.args.text.path="text.txt"
    LABEL org.inginious.batch.args.text.name="A simple text field"
    LABEL org.inginious.batch.args.text.description="Please enter something here (won't be used at all)"

    # And a file
    LABEL org.inginious.batch.args.file=file
    LABEL org.inginious.batch.args.file.path="yourfile"
    LABEL org.inginious.batch.args.file.name="Submit a file here"
    LABEL org.inginious.batch.args.file.description="This file will be made available in the results as 'yourfile'"

As you can see:

- All batch containers must have a line ``LABEL org.inginious.batch=1`` in their Dockerfile
- Args types are indicated via the lines ``LABEL org.inginious.batch.args.KEY=TYPE``, where ``KEY`` and ``TYPE`` are of course the type and
  the key name of the argument.
- Args names are indicated via the lines ``LABEL org.inginious.batch.args.KEY.name="THE NAME"``
- Args path are indicated via the lines ``LABEL org.inginious.batch.args.KEY.path="THE/PATH/INSIDE/SLASH/INPUT"``
- Args descriptions are indicated via the lines ``LABEL org.inginious.batch.args.KEY.description="THE DESCRIPTION"``
